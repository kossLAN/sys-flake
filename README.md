  My trash system flake that you SHOULD NOT use!
</h1>

## Why you should not copy me
  - This is highly personal and not well documented because of that
  - I make mistakes/and or I'm lazy with this repo because I am the only customer
  - It's valuable to learn nix for yourself to effectively use it for yourself
  - If you do end up copying me I apologize...

## Credits (Cool people I copied/talked nix with)
 [Misterio77](https://github.com/Misterio77), [outfoxxed](https://git.outfoxxed.me/) and probably others...

## Nice to know's 
  - Build a system(alternatively use nh):
    
    ```nixos-rebuild --flake .#<system> switch|boot```
